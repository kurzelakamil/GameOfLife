# GameOfLife

This repo imitates Game Of Life. 

Version 1.0:

In 10x10 tab, program generates random 50 dead cell(black), every press on 'Next turn' button causes check which cells will be dead and alive in next turn. It is checking as below:
-If dead cell has exactly 3 dead neighbours, then in next turn become alive
-If alive cell has 2 or 3 neighburs, then in next turn still is alive, otherwise dies.

Project will be continuing and I plan to add possibility to set number of cells(size) and number of dead cells at the beggining.

Version 1.1:
Added below funcionalities:
-user can choose size of table and number of dead cells at the beginning
-program counts turns
-user can set turn changing as automatically and any moment can pause it

Next version will be stopping when nothing more can change(any cell) and show how many turns was needed to reach it.
